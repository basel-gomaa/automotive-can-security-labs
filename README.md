# Automotive CAN Security Labs

This repository contains hands-on automotive cybersecurity labs focused on
Controller Area Network (CAN) communication, ECU simulation, encrypted payloads,
and active attack scenarios.

The project demonstrates how ECUs exchange both encrypted and unencrypted
messages over CAN, how attacks can be executed on the bus, and how basic
defensive checks can detect spoofed or malformed frames.

All implementations are for educational and research purposes only.
